# Vinyl Machines

## What are they for?

Vinyl machines can create things like stickers, posters, decals for cars and windows, and more.

## What materials do they use?

There's a few materials to remember, luckily you can get a feel for them.

### Matte Calendared Vinyl

- This vinyl is matte, has a portion that peels off with a sticky underside, and a white backing. This is best for wall decals and stickers.

### Clear Calendared Vinyl

- This vinyl is glossy, also has a portion that peels, but the portion that peels off is clear. 
- This vinyl looks very similar to heat transfer vinyl.
- **Caveat**: Any white portions of your print will *not* show up if you use the clear calendared vinyl.

#### Applying to a surface

- Clean the surface off, make sure there's no dust or anything on it.
- Spritz the surface with water
- Apply the clear sticky portion to the surface
- Squeegee the water out from below the decal

### Heat Transfer Backing

- This should *never* go into the printer.
- When you peel this, the backing is not very sticky compared to something like clear calendared vinyl.

### Heat Transfer Vinyl

- Matte, very thin when peeled.
- Heat transfer images generally don't last very long on cotton. If someone insists on heat transferring something onto cotton fabric, tell them to (handwash) cold, and air dry.
